I'm Yanis Falaki, an incoming Electrical Engineering student at Concordia University. I've been programming since I was 9 years old, having started with video game devolopment in C# and the Unity game engine back in 2015.

Today, Iâ€™m driven to learn as deeply and broadly as possible. That includes ML/AI, GPU Programming, Compilers, Graphics programming, and eventually (and hopefully throughout my degree), I'll learn about the physical processes that enable us to build chips, FPGAs, cars, rocket ships, etc. Basically, I want to be a polymath and know everything there is to know. (How else could I become a billionaire?!)

My favourite language is probably C++, as everything is explicit and there's very little room for ambiguity.
