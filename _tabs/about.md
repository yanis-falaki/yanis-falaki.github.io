I'm Yanis Falaki, an incoming Electrical Engineering student at Concordia University. I've been programming since I was 9 years old, having started with video game development in C# and the Unity game engine back in 2015.

Today, Iâ€™m driven to learn as deeply and broadly as possible. That includes ML/AI, GPU Programming, Compilers, Graphics programming, and eventually (and hopefully throughout my degree), I'll learn about the physical processes that enable us to build chips, FPGAs, cars, rocket ships, etc. In essence, I want to be a polymath and know everything there is to know.

My favourite language is probably C++, as everything is explicit and there's very little room for ambiguity.
